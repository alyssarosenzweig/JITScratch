JITScratch is a framework for server-side Scratch.

To compile a server to the file system, run a command in the format of..
# node gencode PROJECT_ID > PROJECT_ID.js

To run the NodeFront, do:
# node NodeFront

NodeFront runs on port 8088

The protocol is in the form of arrays with / as delimiter.
L/X/ -- loads the module onto the server project, X
returns L/X/, X being the module number

P/X/Y/Z1/Z2/Z3../ZN/ -- runs a procedure. X is the module number, Y is the procedure name, in the form of procedureN, N being procedure #, and the Z's being parameters
